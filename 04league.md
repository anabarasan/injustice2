## 2023-05-28 - Tier 4

Joined a new League (DC Knights) today. They are doing T4.

Seems each boss is 2.4 mill approx,

Somebody had already defeataed Gorilla Grodd & half of Dr Fate was done.  So finished the other half of Dr. Fate.

Was able to defeat Scarecrow & Captain Cold solo.

For Dr Fate I used the LOA team, had to struggle to do the 1 mil damage that was required.

Not sure how the BN team is going to work out.

from what I have seen, they can do around 1.5 mill damage, but anything more is going to be difficult.

Let's see if I will get chance against Brainiac, and see how the teams perform.

#### Observations:

Seems I have only two teams with which I can finish the boss fully.

* KOAA (Nora's Snow Globe) + Raven + Dr. Fate 
* BWTD (Sharp Scythe) + BMWL (Dark Metal Cards) + RK

The other teams that I have are

* LLTJ (Catchy Hook Lv1) + HBHQ (Claws of Horus Lv10) + EPI
* BNGG (Amulet of Might Lv5 + BNR (Kryptonian Regeneration Matrix Lv5) + BNCW (Zatanna's Puppet Lv1)
* CWW + CSM (Kryptonian Regeneration Matrix Lv3) + CBM
* JLAM + JLTF + JLCy (Staff Lvl1)

So if I solo, I think I can handle the base bosses (GG, DF, SC, CC) with 5 pips, leaving 4 pips for Brainiac.

In Theory:

* GG - Dark Metal Team
* DF - LOA + BN 
* SC - KOAA + Raven + DF
* CC - Dark Metal Team

for Brainiac:

on Day 2 then I have to use BN team of LOA, have to see if we can finish atleast one Phase.

on Day 3 Will have to try to finish Phase 2 and Phase 3 with Dark Metal Team  and see if we can enter Phase 4 with the first pip.  I Don't think doing Three Phases with Dark Metal Team in T4 is possible.
Then after that either try to finish off Phase 4 with KOAA + Raven + AAA in second pip.
Or try some other team on second pip to do as much damage as possible before Annihilation, 
and then use the KOAA + Raven team to finish off Phase 4.

Soloing T4 with current Character Builds might be possible, but it is going to be tight, with no room for mistakes.
